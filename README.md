To contribute, first create an issue.
Next, tag your issue appropriately as to whether it's a bug fix or a feature.

For bugs, list the steps that will reproduce the bug in the issue's description.

Describe in a high-level overview what your changes do.

Next, create a fork of the repository on GitHub's website.

Then, on the original repository, create a pull request to merge your fork's branch into main.

We will then review your changes. We may request additional changes before we can merge into main.
