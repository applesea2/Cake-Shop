## ✊ Contributing Guide:

0. To contribute, first create or pick an issue.

### Creating an issue 
1. If you create an issue, tag your issue appropriately as to whether it's a bug fix or a feature.
2. For new bug-tagged issues, list the steps that will reproduce the bug in the issue's description.
3. For new feature issues, describe in a high-level overview what improvements you would like to see.


### Picking an issue
1. Visit the issues tab of the original Github repo and pick an issue that you would like to develop.
3. Once you have picked an issue that you like, comment on its issue page that you would like to be assigned to the issue.
4. A maintainer will assign the issue to you the next time they check the repository.
5. Create a fork of the repository on GitHub's website.
6. Clone the repo to your local machine.
7. Create a new local branch for that fork, and create your changes. 
8. Commit your changes to your local branch.
9. Push your local branch's changes to your fork.
10. Then, on the original or the main repository's GitHub page, create a pull request to merge your fork's branch into main.
11. We will then review your changes. We may request additional change commits from you before we can merge into main.

We welcome everyone as contributors! We appreciate your help and efforts 💗
